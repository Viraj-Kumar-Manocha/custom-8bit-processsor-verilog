## 📖 Overview

This project implements a custom **8-bit processor** built entirely from the ground up — from the ALU to the top-level datapath — using a **24-bit instruction word** for extended opcode and operand flexibility. It supports arithmetic/logic operations, immediate operations, memory access, and control-flow instructions (branch/jump).

Every module (ALU, Register File, Memory, Decoder, Program Counter, etc.) was individually designed, verified with its own testbench, and then integrated into a top-level CPU that was validated by running a **Fibonacci sequence generator program** end-to-end. The design was then synthesized in Xilinx Vivado to evaluate real hardware performance.

This project was built to deepen understanding of computer architecture fundamentals — instruction decoding, datapath control, and single cycle hardware design — by implementing every stage manually in RTL rather than using a pre-built core.

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

Each module was verified independently before system integration:

| Module              | Testbench                       |   Status   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|:----------:|
| ALU                 | `tb_alu.v`                      | ✅ Passed  |
| Register File       | `tb_reg_file.v`                 | ✅ Passed  |
| Data Memory         | `tb_memory.v`                   | ✅ Passed  |
| Instruction Memory  | `tb_instruction_memory.v`       | ✅ Passed  |
| Decoder             | `tb_decoder.v`                  | ✅ Passed  |
| Program Counter     | `tb_program_counter.v`          | ✅ Passed  |
| **Top Module**      | `tb_top_fibonacci.v`            | ✅ Passed  |

### 🐇 System-Level Test — Fibonacci Sequence

The complete CPU was validated by loading a Fibonacci sequence generator program into instruction memory and running it through the fully integrated datapath. The correct sequence was produced and verified against expected values, confirming that instruction fetch, decode, execution, memory access, and register writeback all function correctly together.

## 📊 Synthesis Results

The design was synthesized using **Xilinx Vivado**.

| Metric                     | Result              |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Max Operating Frequency    | **~407 MHz**        |
| Target Tool                | Xilinx Vivado       |
| HDL                        | Verilog             |

### 📐 Max Frequency Calculation

Fmax is derived from the Worst Negative Slack (WNS) reported by Vivado's timing analysis:

Achievable Clock Period = Target Clock Period − WNS  
Fmax = 1 / Achievable Clock Period

Target Period = 10.000 ns → WNS = +7.544 ns → Achievable Period = 2.456 ns → Fmax ≈ 407 MHz

Target Period = 3.000 ns → WNS = +0.544 ns → Achievable Period = 2.456 ns → Fmax ≈ 407 MHz

Target Period = 2.456 ns → WNS = +0.000 ns → Achievable Period = 2.456 ns → Fmax ≈ 407 MHz

## 🧠 Design Decisions

- **24-bit ISA instead of 8/16-bit:**  
  Chosen to allow flexible encoding of opcode, register indices, and immediate values without excessive instruction constraints.

- **Single-cycle architecture:**  
  Simplifies control logic and ensures deterministic execution at the cost of longer critical path.

- **Modular datapath design:**  
  Each component (ALU, Register File, Decoder) was independently verified before integration to ensure correctness and scalability.

- **Separate instruction and data memory:**  
  Enables cleaner architecture and avoids structural hazards.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) (Design Suite)

### Running Simulations
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Viraj-Kumar-Manocha/custom-8bit-processor-verilog.git
   cd custom-8bit-processor-verilog
   ```
2. Open Vivado and create a new project, adding all files from `rtl/` as design sources.
3. Add the desired testbench from `tb/` as a simulation source.
4. Run **Behavioral Simulation** to view waveforms in the Vivado waveform viewer.

### Running Synthesis
1. With all `rtl/` files added as design sources, run **Synthesis** in Vivado.
2. Open the **Timing Summary** report to view the achievable maximum frequency.
